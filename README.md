# Duka-TODO Mobile App

Hi, my name is Manzi Asifiwe and this is a challenge app. It is a todo app and it stores data locally. We are going to see the requirements to install the app and use test it.


## Features

 - Duka Todo app is **offline**
 - It has both **Light Theme** and **Dark Theme**
 - You have the ability to **add tasks** and **delete tasks**

## Requirements

To run the app locally, you will need the following:

 - Node
 - Expo-cli
 - Expo-go android or ios app
 - npm or Yarn
 - Git

#### Recommended tools

 - [ ] VS Code
 - [ ] **PowerShell** for windows users

### Steps

Using Git, clone this project and 

    cd .\Duka-TODO

If it is your first time run the following commands:

    npm install
or if you use yarn 

    yarn
then run `yarn start` or `expo start`

You should now see a QR code that should be scanned using the expo go app to run Duka TODO
